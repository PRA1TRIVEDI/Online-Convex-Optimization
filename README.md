Consider the problem of prediction with expert advice with d = 10. Assume that the losses assigned to each expert are generated according to independent Bernoulli distributions. The adversary/environment generates loss for experts 1 to 8 according to Ber(.5) in each round. For the 9th expert, loss is generated according to Ber(.5 − ∆) in each round. The losses for the 10th expert are generated according to different Bernoulli random variable in each round for the first T /2 rounds, they are generated according to Ber(0.5 + ∆) and the remaining T /2 rounds they are generated according to Bernoulli random variable Ber(0.5 − 2∆). ∆ = 0.1 and T = 10^5. It is implemeted for FLT with 20 epochs.
